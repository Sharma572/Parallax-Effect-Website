<h2>What is Parallax scrolling effect?</h2>
Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique used in web design where background images throughout a web page move slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth on a two-dimensional site.

<h2>Why Parallax effect is chosen for the projects?</h2>
Parallax websites create instant appeal: they stand out from other websites and engage several senses all at once. The slick interlocking elements in parallax style sites flow naturally up and down the page. They provide a user-experience improvement not seen since the beginnings of the Web 2.0 revolution.
It has the ability to create a dynamic, interactive user experience that can be very visually appealing. You can put all your content on one page so that users do not have to navigate through several different pages or wait for them to load.

<h2> HOW did i make the project ? </h2>
In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the background typically moves much more slowly, giving the illusion of depth. Done correctly, parallax scrolling produces a fascinating and seamless virtual experience.

If you want to add a parallax scrolling effect to your website, you should consider the following tips.

Use it selectively. Parallax scrolling is much more powerful when you use it on one particular element as opposed to all pages and all the time. Use it in headers and titles, or maybe on your home page only. You want parallax scrolling to strengthen your website’s design, not distract users.
Image compression is key. Parallax scrolling uses a variety of media files and CSS shapes to create a sense of depth. You don’t want to compromise your web performance and user experience with large image files that load too slowly.
Play with color. Parallax scrolling isn’t just about the images in the foreground and background, but about color, too. You might use more desaturated tones in the background and more lively colors in the foreground to create an even greater sense of depth.
